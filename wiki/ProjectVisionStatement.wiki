Rapid Rider

While bus schedules for the Rapid, Grand Rapid's public bus transit system, are available online and in print, it can be a hassle to figure out the best route to a certain bus stops. Rapid Rider will allow a user to find the nearest bus stop near your location (based on GPS information). It will also provide you with departure times heading.

The RR PostgreSQL database will store information on each buses' schedule and the location of each bus stop.  A GPS device will provide the user's location, and a simple map-based GUI will allow the user to choose a destination in the greater Grand Rapids area.  RR will use all of this data to create a list of instructions for traveling via 
the Rapid to the requested bus stop.
