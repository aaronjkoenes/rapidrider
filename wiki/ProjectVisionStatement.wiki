=== Rapid Rider ===

While bus schedules for the [http://www.ridetherapid.org/ Rapid], Grand Rapid's public bus transit system, are available online and in print, it can be a hassle to figure out the best route to a certain bus stop. The intent of the Rapid Rider application is to be a total solution for the typical "green" user who prefers to use the public transportation system. Rapid Rider is a mobile application which will allow a user to find the nearest bus stop given your current location (based on GPS information). It will also provide you with departure times and heading (direction of travel). 

The Rapid Rider database will store information on each buses' schedule and the location of each bus stop. The database will be internet accessible so that when the user's device is in a WiFi hotspot the application will calculate directions with current bus schedule data. A GPS device will provide the user's location, and a simple map-based GUI will allow the user to choose a destination in the greater Grand Rapids area.  Rapid Rider will use all of this data to create a list of instructions for traveling via the 
[http://www.ridetherapid.org/ Rapid] to the requested bus stop.
