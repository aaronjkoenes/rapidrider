#summary This page is a summary of our results from the user tests.

= Introduction =

We started each user test by explaining the purpose of our application and little bit about how it works. We then started the application and let them use it. We explained to them that they couldn't do anything wrong and if any problems arise that they are our fault. We recorded their reactions, questions, and opinions. We gave little to no guidance while they used the application.


= Details for each test =

== User #1 ==
  * Didn't understand what "Pause" was for.
  * Was confused on how to enter a destination.
  * Would have liked to see a drop-down list of bus stops.
  * Typed in "mall" and got back "Claystone & East Beltline" for a arrival stop.
  * Wants to see the stops labeled ("Start Stop", "End Stop").
  * Had a lot of trouble typing in the on-screen keyboard.
  * Typed their address and got back "Fuller & Leonard", this is not the closest stop (this is due to lack of routes in the database).
  * When the Palm went to sleep, it froze the application.
  * Said they would use it, if they rode the bus.

== User #2 ==
  * When trying to type a "w" in portrait mode they would end up clicking "Exit" (Palm has a broken screen).
  * Was confused by the two stops that were given back. "Which do I go to?"
  * "woodland mall" -> "Ottawa & Fulton" (way wrong).
  * Felt landscape mode helped.
  * Felt the Exit button was too close to the on-screen keyboard.

== User #3 ==
  * Moved closer to GPS Device to get it to connect.
  * Felt the results need labels.
  * Wanted a way to reset the input field.
  * Had trouble typing while it connected to the GPS Device.
  * "calvin collegee" -> "Raybrook & Burton".

== User #4 ==
  * Typed in "museum" and pressed return on the on-screen keyboard. This inserted a return in the field. Then tapped "Get Route" and received an XML parsing error.
  * Removed the return and tapped "Get Route". This resulted in just "Ottawa and Fulton" being displayed along with the error from before.
  * Didn't know what it was doing when the application was restarted. (it was connecting to the GPS Device).

= Things Learned =
  * Implement more routes.
  * "Pause" should change the "Status" to "paused"
  * While the application is connecting to the GPS Device it should change the status to "connecting..."
  * Label "Start Stop" and "End Stop"
  * Find a solution to prevent the Palm from freezing when it goes to sleep while the application is running.
  * When a destination is not found it defaults to "Ottawa & Pearl", how can we fix this?
  * Add a "Clear" button to clear the destination input field.
  * Remove returns when they are input into the destination field. Or capture them to run "Get Route".
