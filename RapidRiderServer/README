RapidRider CS 262 Project
    http://code.google.com/p/rapidrider/


Setup Eclipse with a RapidRider server project:

  0. Skip to step 7 if you are working on a computer in the u-lab.
  
  1. Install PostgreSQL.  I am using version 8.3.4 from the Ubuntu repository,
     and it is working fine.  I don't know what is installed in the lab right 
     now.  PostgreSQL can be found at:
     
  http://www.postgresql.org/
  
  2. Install pgAdmin.  This may not be necessary, but it is the program that we
     are using in the lab to work with PostgreSQL databases.  I also installed
     this from the Ubuntu repositories.  The pgAdmin site is:
  
  http://www.pgadmin.org/
  
  3. Setup PostgreSQL.  Make sure that you have a PostgreSQL user named 
     "postgres" with the CS 262 password.  I forget all of the details of this 
     step.  Feel free to contact Greg if you have trouble.
     
  4. Create a server in pgAdmin.  The name can be anything.  The host should be
     "localhost", or the IP of the machine with the database on it, I think.
     The username should be "postgres", and the password should the CS 262 
     password.  Connect to this server once you have created it.
     
  5. Install JBoss.  In the u-lab, we are using JBoss 4.0.4.GA.  I am using 
     version 4.2.3.GA, and it works better for me.  Both versions can be found
     at:
  
  http://www.jboss.org/jbossas/downloads/
  
  6. Install the JBossIDE Eclipse plugin.  JBossIDE is depricated in favor of 
     JBossTools, but we are using JBossIDE in the u-lab.  We are using version
     1.6.0.GA.  Download the file JBossIDE-1.6.0.GA-ALL.zip from:
  
  http://www.jboss.org/jbosside/download/index.html
  
     Extract this zip file, and then tell Eclipse to use the extracted 
     directory as a local update site.  Install all five of the available 
     packages.
     
  7. Create the rapidrider database.  Once you are connected to the database 
     server in pgAdmin, create a new database named "rapidrider".  Then, select
     to "Restore..." this database from the right-click drop down menu.
     Restore from the backup file on the RapidRider project page.  The URL is:
     
  http://rapidrider.googlecode.com/files/database.backup
  
  8. Check out the RapidRiderServer source code.  Use Subclipse to check out 
     the Google Code repository located at:
  
  https://rapidrider.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/
  
     You will need your Google Code password which can be found in your profile.
     
  9. Tell Eclipse where to find the Postgres JDBC adapter.  Open up the 
     Properties for the project.  Go to Java Build Path.  Go to the Libraries 
     tab.  Click Add Variable.  And add a variable PSQL that points to your 
     Postgres JDBC adapter jar file.  That file can be downloaded from:
     
  http://cs.calvin.edu/curriculum/cs/262/kvlinden/resources/postgresql-8.1-407.jdbc3.jar
  
  10. Start JBoss.  Go to your installation of JBoss and run the run file for 
     your operating system in the bin/ directory.
     
  11. Build the war file.  In the Properties for the project, make sure that 
     "Enable XDoclet" and "Enable Packaging" are both configured in their 
     respective tabs.  The XDoclet Configuration tab might show an error
     every time you click on it, but this doesn't appear to be a real problem.
     Then, right click on the project and click "Run XDoclet".  Then, right 
     click on the project and click "Run Packaging".  Now you should have a
     rapidRiderServlet.war file.
     
  12. Deploy the servlet.  Copy the rapidRiderServlet.war file from the project
     to <JBoss install directory>/server/default/deploy/rapidRiderServlet.war
     One way to do this is by right clicking the war file and "Exporting" it
     to that location.
     
  13. Browse to the XML.  Point your browser to 
  
  http://localhost:8080/rapidRiderServlet/RapidRider
  
     and see the XML.
     
  13. If you see a ClassNotFoundException talking about org.postgresql.Driver,
     then you may need to copy the Postgres JDBC adapter jar file into the
     JBoss deploy folder.  I am not sure why this is.  I have encountered this
     problem on my own development machine and the Windows server that is set
     up in the u-lab.
     
  14. If you have any questions or see any problems with these instructions,
     please contact Greg Clark about it.
