RapidRider CS 262 Project
    http://code.google.com/p/rapidrider/


This file contains instructions for:
  * Setting up the RapidRider project in Eclipse.
  * Installing the RapidRider midlet on a Palm device.
  
NOTE: Instructions for setting up a RapidRider server can be found in the README
for the server project.


Setup Eclipse with a RapidRider project:

  A simple 12 step process to get you up and running in an amount of time that
  could be measured in seconds or any other time unit:
  
  NOTE: Most of these steps are not specific to RapidRider and could be used to 
  setup a development environment for any of the CS 262 projects.

  0. Skip to step 6 if you are working on a computer in the u-lab.
  
  1. Install Eclipse.  Europa (3.2) should work.  I haven't gotten 
     Ganymede (3.4) to work for this project.  Europa can be downloaded from 
     Calvin's mirror at:
     
  http://mirror.calvin.edu/eclipse/downloads/drops/R-3.2-200606291905/index.php

     NOTE: Calvin's mirror is down right now.  You will have to find somewhere 
     else to download Eclipse 3.2 from.

  2. Install WTK.  In the lab we are using 2.5 Beta, but it was only released
     for Windows, and WTK 2.5.2 works fine.  It can be found at:
     
  http://java.sun.com/products/sjwtoolkit/download.html

     Scroll to the bottom of the page, select Download, and follow the
     instructions.
     
  3. Install Subclipse.  In Eclipse, install Subclipse and either 
     SVNKit Adapter or JavaHL Adapter from the update site at:
     
  http://subclipse.tigris.org/update_1.4.x
  
     I chose SVNKit.  It works OK.  Subclipse gets a bit confused sometimes
     though.
  
  4. Download Tidalwave.  The Tidalwave jar from lab 2 works fine.  It can be
     found at:
     
  http://cs.calvin.edu/curriculum/cs/262/kvlinden/resources/tidalwave0.4.jar

     You will need the CS 262 password.  Put this jar somewhere safe where you
     can link to it from inside Eclipse.
  
  5. Install EclipseME.  I have not been able to get the newest version of 
     EclipseME (1.7.9) to work with Tidalwave.  (I don't really know what the 
     problem is though.)  EclipseME 1.5.5 is installed in the lab.  It can be
     found at:
  
  http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=86829&package_id=90314

     Extract this zip file, and then tell Eclipse to use the extracted directory
     as a local update site.
  
  6. Check out the RapidRider source code with Subclipse.  The location of the 
     Google Code repository is:
     
  https://rapidrider.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/
  
     You will need your Google Code password which can be found in your profile.
    
     Eclipse will probably show some errors, but the next two steps should take
     care of them.
  
  7. Tell Eclipse where Tidalwave is.  Open up the Properties for the project.
     Go to Java Build Path.  Go to the Libraries tab.  Click Add Variable.  And
     add a variable TIDALWAVE that points to your Tidalwave jar file.
     
  8. Tell Eclipse where KXML is.  Open up the Properties for the project.
     Go to Java Build Path.  Go to the Libraries tab.  Click Add Variable.  Add
     a variable KXML_PARSER that points to your KXML jar file.  That jar can
     be downloaded from:
     
  http://cs.calvin.edu/curriculum/cs/262/kvlinden/resources/kxml2-2.3.0.jar
  
  9. Tell Eclipse about J2ME.  Open the Properties for the project.  Select the
     J2ME tab.  If you are in the u-lab, you will probably be able to set the
     Group to the single option and be good to go.  
     
     Otherwise, click Manage Devices.  Then click Import. Then select the root 
     of the WTK directory, and refresh the device list.  Choose the device you 
     would like the emulator to use.
     
  10. Tell Eclipse to compile backwards compatable code.  Open the Properties 
     for the project.  Select Java Compiler.  Enable project specific settings.
     Select Java 1.3 for the compiler compliance level.
  
  11. Right click the main Midlet class and run it as an Emulated J2ME Midlet.
  
  12. If you get stuck or have any questions feel free to contact Greg Clark.


Deploy RapidRider to a real Palm device:

  NOTE:  These instructions are probably incomplete.  I would appreciate it
     if other people would fill in some of the details.

  0. Get a Palm device.  We are using the Palm TX.  Sometimes it is necessary to
     do a hard rest on the Palm device.  If the Palm does not need to be hard 
     reset, skip to step N.
  
  1. Hard reset the Palm.  Hold down the power button and press the reset button
     on the back with the stylus.  Keep holding the power button until you see
     the silver Palm Powered icon.  Then press up and tell the Palm to erase all
     of its data.
     
  2. Install Palm Desktop onto your computer.  This can be found at:
  
  http://www.palm.com/us/support/palmdesktop.html
  
  3. Install Java onto the Palm device.  The IBM WEME J9 Java micro edition 
     virtual machine can be found at:
  
  http://cs.calvin.edu/curriculum/cs/262/kvlinden/resources/WEME571.zip
     
     Unzip this file and use Palm Desktop to install it onto your Palm.
  
  4. Install the RapidRider midlet on the Palm.  Go into the IBM virtual machine
     on the Palm.  Tap Install and enter the URL for either the .jad or the .jar
     file.  Skip to step 8 if you just installed RapidRider to your Palm for the
     first time.

  5. Update the midlet version number.  Make sure the .jad file's version number
     is larger than it was last time it was installed on the Palm device.
     
  6. Recreate a midlet property.  In the .jad file, select the Midlet tab in 
     Eclipse.  Apparently, it is necessary delete and then recreate the one 
     entry in this property.  I don't know why this is necessary.  The property
     should have name "RapidRider", and the class should be 
     "rapidrider.RapidRiderMidlet".
     
     Currently, the RapidRider midlet does not have an icon. 

  7. Update the RapidRider midlet on the Palm.
  
  8. Use the landscape view.  Some of the Palm devices we have in the lab have 
     unusable sections on their screens.  Using landscape mode, instead of
     portrait mode, makes it easier to use the Palm in general.
     
  9. Set settings on the Palm.  Changing some settings on the Palm stops the
     Palm from asking whether or not it is allowed to connect to the GPS and to
     the server so frequently.
  
  10. Start the RapidRider application.  In the application menu, select the
     RapidRider Midlet Suite.
  

Install StarUML in Linux:

  With some effort, this is possible.  I got it to work using Wine and copying 
  over one extra .dll file for parsing XML.  If you have any questions about 
  this contact Greg Clark.
