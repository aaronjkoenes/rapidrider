RapidRider CS 262 Project
    http://code.google.com/p/rapidrider/


This project contains the RapidRider unit tests for the client side.  They are 
not in the same project as the client because the client, as a midlet, needs to
be run under Java 1.3.  But JUnit requires introspection, which is not provided
by Java 1.3.  JUnit 3.8.1 works with Java 5, and JUnit 4 requires Java 6.

Some other unit testing frameworks have been developed for testing midlets.
They include J2MEUnit, JMUnit, Mobile JUnit, CLDC Unit, and MoMEUnit.  These 
unit testing libraries all run with Java 1.3, and allow the tests to be run on
the device that the midlet is developed for.  But since Java 1.3 lacks 
introspection, they are also harder to use than the standard JUnit.

The unit tests in this project are written to easily be transformed from JUnit
tests into unit tests that run under the other frameworks.
